# Login Form
This project demonstrates client-side form validation using plain JavaScript.
It checks whether the user has entered valid details before allowing form submission.




## Features

- ✅ Username validation (minimum 3 characters required)
- ✅ Password validation (minimum 6 characters required)
- ✅ Error messages displayed dynamically
- ✅ Prevents form submission until all fields are valid


## Technologies Used
HTML5 – For form structure

CSS3 – For styling (optional)

JavaScript  – For validation logic
## How It Works
1. The form contains Username and Password fields.

2 . When the user clicks Submit, JavaScript runs validation checks:

- Username must be at least 3 characters long.

- Password must be at least 6 characters long.

3. If validation fails, → an error message is shown.

4. If validation passes → success message is shown
